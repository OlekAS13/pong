## About Pong
In Pong you need to hit the ball with your bat and try to score by hitting your opponent's side. When someone scores 15 points they win and the game ends. In this version you can play with a opponent or a bot in a One-player mode. The bot plays perfectly so the only way to end the game is to loose. When you start a game the ball is served on random side after two seconds from random height. Then when someone scored the ball it's also served after two seconds from random height but on the side that lost.

## Controls
* Mouse buttons - start game
* S - open settings menu
* ESC - close settings menu
* W / I - move bat upwards (Two-player)
* S / K - move bat downwards (Two-player)

## Settings
* Ball rotation mode - choose which rotation mode you want to play with.
    * Dynamic - the closer the ball's center is to the center of the bat the straighter the angle will be
    * Static - if you hit the ball with the same half of the bat that the ball is coming from it will get reflected back by 180 degrees but if ball hits the other half it will get reflected by 90 degrees
* Mode - choose if you want to play with real opponent or with a bot.
    * Two-player - you play with real opponent and control the bat using your keyboard
    * One-player - you play with a bot and control the bat with your mouse
* Bat speed - choose which speed the bat will move with (Two-player).
    * Fast - the bat moves faster
    * Slow - the bat moves slower
